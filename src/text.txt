(- problem here - once the bottom of our overflow container is reached, to load new photos
-problem - i wanted to have useRef and a getBoundingClientRect property on the overflow element (to manage the scroll event), but i was getting nothing but 'null'. Its certain about the 'map method', but i cant see a solution now. for the moment, i will keep the whole page as a scroll event. 
-problem - big problem when i had the scroll event in the globalContext - even though pages were different, the scroll functionality was still invoked
)


DONE- when diary is saved, to have also the date and the hour
DONE - when edites are made, write also the date and the hour
Dont know how - focus on writing when notepad is opened

DONE- to add a delete option for each diary, and also once the delete button appears, to display a verification: 'are you sure, bro?'
also: maybe to have some interesting delete functionality where you have to check each element that you want to delete.
DONE- when description is longer than the container, to add the option 'read more'
DONE- scroll back to the edited item


DONE- welcome page
DONE -deleting alert

DONE-if no image in note, to write 'add image'
DONE- if after edit item remains the same, not to add any 'edit date info'

DONE- idea!: once the element is editing, to cover it with a shadow background and to write 'editing... ';
DONE- spontaneous idea!: when notepad is opened, to have a music link to youtube 
DONE- when an item is being edited, to not be able to add to edit another one

DONE-textarea - to disable all decorations when clicked(no border...)

DONE-when item is being edited, to not be able to delete it - to show alert: "note is being edited"

DONE-authentification page: - to have a background image and in the center the element with login and free inscription
  - wihout auth, to not be able to access the "/page" page

DONE -logout - if a note is editing, to display on the welcome page(page where the Link goes) an 'alert' with 'all changes were saved' - and to save changes

DONE- changes alert appears only when changes are made

DONE - once the element is edited, will be awesome to scroll back to its position in the list
DONE - to change dinamically the buttons 

DONE-youtube - on hover, to display below a div and to write something - calming music for writing
     - very awesome idea: to display some playlist idea in form of dots(or other forms) and once hovered, to display the name of the playlist and a youtube icon which, once clicked, will navigate to the youtube playlist
     - when the dot is clicked, to navigate to that youtube page

DONE -page - once description is added, to have a bounce animation to the save button

18.10:

DONE - the problem with the scroll was solved by addind id to each element and finding it by using getElementById
DONE -created a separate componen for DeleteAlert, because the question about the note contained the date for the first item added in the list.
SOLVED -encountered difficulties while having an 'onmouseover' with an icon - when it comes to the path of the svg, the className differs so i couldnt display correctly the sublinks

DONE -local storage for diary list


SOLVED problem: photo doesnt want to change(was just a bug)

SOLVED - no  photo on the written note: when photo is chosed, to scroll to the element - there is how the above bug appears! now if i try to change a photo, i cannot do it - another note's photo is changed

DONE - to have also a break-word in the diary list - better to have an overflow option and to have the button above

Home page:
SOLVED !problem - when input is clicked, it searches...
DONE-to have the emotional states on the whole page

DONE- scroll to photos container when an ES is clicked
WORKES to check: if i search multiple times with 'other' input, does it change the photos? 
DONE-feedback form at the end of all the notes - feedback button - when clicked, to have an element that appears

SOLVED - problem: when user comes back from feedback page, to refresh the feedback input form
